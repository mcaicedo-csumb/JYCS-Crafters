# FuelTrack — by JYCS-Crafters 🚗⛽

**JYCS = Jose · Ysabelle · Camila · Stan** — we built FuelTrack with ❤️ to make car life simple: log fill-ups, see costs, and keep your garage tidy.

## What you can do
- 🛞 **Garage:** manage cars, switch fast, stay organized.
- ⛽ **Fuel logs:** add fill-ups (date, odo, gallons, price, total, location).
- 📊 **Stats:** quick insights on spend & cost per mile.
- 🛠 **Settings:** edit display name, change password (with strength check), or **deactivate** your account (soft delete).
- 🧑‍💼 **Admin:** add users, deactivate/reactivate, and safe-delete (no deleting the currently logged-in admin).

## Why it’s safe & friendly
- 🔐 Passwords are **hashed** (no plaintext), inactive users can’t log in.
- 📴 Works offline with **Room**.
- ✅ Clear toasts & confirmations so you always know what happened.

Made with love by **JYCS-Crafters** — because better data makes better drives. ❤️
